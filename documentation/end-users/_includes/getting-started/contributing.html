  <h1 id="contributing" class="page-header">Contributing</h1>

  <p class="lead">We welcome contributions to the BAS Style Kit from anyone at any skill level.</p>
  <p>A contribution may include things like documentation changes or improvements through to a fundamental refactoring of grid styles or adding a new custom component.</p>

  <h2>Issue tracking</h2>
  <p>For reporting bugs and issues, proposing changes or new additions or for any other general feedback please use our <a href="{{ site.issues }}">issue tracker, Jira</a>.</p>
  <p>To quickly report an issue to through Jira, use the <a {{ site.feedback_attributes }}>issue submission form</a>.</p>
  <p>If reporting an issue through Jira directly please use the <strong>BAS Style Kit</strong> project.</p>

  <h2 id="contributing-discussions">Discussions</h2>
  <p>For more general feedback or for discussions on best practice etc. where there is no clear or "right" answer,
  please add a topic <a href="{{ site.discussions_url }}">to this document</a>.</p>
  <p class="text-info">We are actively looking into better ways of managing these sorts of discussions so this will improve in the future.</p>

  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <p>Contributions will be accepted from anyone, though it is a assumed you are a BAS employee. <br />
    Other people who may make contributions are contractors for websites, such as those used for the new public website.</p>
  <p class="text-info">Contributions from BAS staff or non-BAS staff are treated in exactly the same way.</p>

  <h2>Protected aspects</h2>
  <p>These are elements of the Style Kit which we likely won't change, for either technical, design or branding reasons. They include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anything relating the BAS logo - though this can be <a href="#contributing-discussions">discussed</a>, the usage and design of the BAS logo is controlled by NERC</li>
    <li>Anything relating to the NERC logo and its branding - similar to the above, this is controlled by NERC</li>
    <li>Font choices and colour schemes - these are design and/or branding decisions and are therefore subject to personal taste</li>
    <li>Fundamental aspects of Bootstrap - this includes things like the grid system, vertical rhythm and component layout</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Development environments</h2>
  <p>To make changes to the underlying code that makes up the BAS Style kit, such as its Less styles, you will need certain tools available on your computer.
    The main project README (<code>/README.md</code>) for this proejct contains detailed instructions on how to setup such an environment, locally or remotely. </p>
  <p>It also contains instructions and guidance on the various Gulp tasks used for processing Less to CSS and copying fonts etc.</p>

  <h2>Pull requests</h2>
  <p>If you have made changes within a development environment you wish to contribute back to this project, please use the following process,
  which uses the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/">Git Flow</a> branching model.</p>

  <p>Ideally pull requests should be made in response to an issue from Jira, so that the wider context is known. However this project will also
  accept unexpected pull requests where this makes sense.</p>

  <p>Changes will be merged into the next release under the project's normal timeline.<br />
    <span class="text-danger">If your change is urgent ensure this is clear in your pull request, or make a <em>hotfix</em> branch, instead of a <em>feature</em> branch described below.</span></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Before you modify the Style Kit, create a <em>feature</em> branch in the <a href="{{ site.repo }}">project repository</a>,
      where possible do this from a Jira issue for automatic linking</li>
    <li>Make your changes, making sure to update documentation where needed</li>
    <li>Update the <code>Changelog</code> using the <a href="http://keepachangelog.com/">keep-a-changelog</a> methodology</li>
    <li>
      Create a pull request to the <em>develop</em> branch of the repository,
      <ul>
        <li>Notify <a href="mailto:felnne@bas.ac.uk">Felix Fennell</a> that you have done this</li>
        <li>The pull-request will be reviewed manually to ensure the changes made won't cause an side-effects and required documentation changes have been made</li>
        <li>Comments may be left for to correcting things like naming conventions or other minor issues</li>
        <li>When these are resolved the changes will be merged into develop in readiness for the next release</li>
        <li>If there is a fundamental issue with your pull request may be left open for a wider discussion and then accepted or rejected accordingly</li>
        <li>In extreme cases your pull request may be rejected, in which case suitable reasoning will be supplied to explain why this happend</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
