  <p class="lead">Sidebars are used to provide accompanying content side by side with main content</p>
  <p class="text-info">This component is unique to the BAS Style Kit, though loosely based on the <a href="#well">well</a> component.</p>

    <h4>You should always use a sidebar variant</h4>
    <p>As with buttons and other components you should always use a sidebar variant, such as <code>.sidebar-bsk-default</code> or <code>.sidebar-bsk-inverse</code> not just the base class.</p>

          <p>The worst that could happen is that I could spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit. COME ON. It was for me. I was going to smoke the marijuana like a cigarette. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar.</p>
          <p>How could I say no to the woman who gave me chlamydia? It's OUR nausea. They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. Heart attack never stopped old big bear! It's Sunday, but screw it — juice box time.</p>
          <p>If I look like a man who made love to his wife last night – it's because I almost did. Stop it, stop it. This objectification of women has to stop. It's just Mom and whores. Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. Turns out he ended up getting too friendly with the teddy bear. If you're suggesting I play favorites, you're wrong. I love all of my children equally. I don't care for Gob. I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich. After all, why should you go to jail for a crime somebody else noticed?</p>
          <p>Did you enjoy your lunch, mom? You drank it fast enough. Well, if you want to play Eve, you got to get in line behind what, above five homos. She tried pesto for the first time. Imagine that, 92 years old and she never tried pesto. It walked on my pillow!</p>

    <h4>Additional styles needed if not using a heading</h4>
    <p>Add <code>.sidebar-bsk-no-heading</code> if a sidebar doesn't start with a heading (<code>h2</code>, <code>h3</code> or <code>h4</code>) to add some extra padding. <br />
      This makes the top edge of the sidebar box meet the top of the main content heading and look <em>right</em>.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="sidebar-sizes">Sidebar sizes</h2>
  <p>Add <code>.sidebar-bsk-lg</code> to use a more padding within a sidebar, use the <a href="css/#grid">grid system</a> to make sidebars wider or narrower overall.</p>

  <h2 id="sidebar-nested">Nested sidebars</h2>
  <p>Its possible to nest a sidebar within another sidebar. This is only supported for one level deep and for sidebars within sidebars. <br />
    However, it should be relatively easy to make work at other depths or elements, please submit a pull-request if you do for this so we can make this component better for everyone.</p>
