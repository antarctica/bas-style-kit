# BAS Style Kit - Developer documentation

## End-user documentation

Other than distributed assets, the end-user documentation is the primary output of this project as it is used by users
to apply the Style Kit to their own projects. It is a static website, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and
modelled on the Bootstrap end-user documentation.

See the relevant sub-section of the *Usage* section in the Project README for environment specific instructions on how
to build and deploy this documentation.
