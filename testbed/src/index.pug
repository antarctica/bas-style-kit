      | The BAS Style Kit uses #[a(href='https://trello.com') Trello] to manage development and collecting feedback for
      | all Style Kit components (including this Testbed) whether positive and negative.

    p
      | As a public open-source project, feedback is welcome from anyone, whether reporting bugs/issues or suggestions
      | for additions/improvements. This project is inheriently related to branding websites as part of the British
      | Antarctic Survey, and therefore some choices are beyond our control.

    p
      | As the testbed is a resource targetting developers, it is expected that feedback generated from this website
      | will be technical in nature., ideally referencing one or more samples (except where suggesting new features).
