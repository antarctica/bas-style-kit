// Button groups

/*
 * This is an annoying Sass bug as it doesn't allow importing files by reference so styles previously can be
 * extended (as is the case in this example). Instead we have to import the styles directly, causing them to be
 * re-emitted.
 *
 * This has the effect here of causing Bootstrap styles to override Style Kit styles, specifically those defined
 * by '_buttons.scss'. This can be overcome by using including the overriden file again to re-override the styles.
 *
 * This is clearly far from ideal, but Sass seems reluctant to add a 'reference' import so we either do this or
 * mess around with the order styles are loaded in (we currently follow the Boostrap load order unless it's
 * something custom).
 *
 * This is considered a bug and is tracked here: https://trello.com/c/U9A8oUi4
