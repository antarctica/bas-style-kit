// 'Problem with this service' page pattern
// --------------------------------------------------
// Page pattern for 'problem with this service' pages where a service cannot be used (AKA 500, 503 error)
//
// Patterns are best practice design solutions for specific user-focused tasks and page types. They combine the
// low level styles, components and interactive elements provided by the Style Kit into higher level solutions.
//
// Page patterns are designed to act as whole, complete, pages or views.
//
// Patterns are not part of Bootstrap and only available in the Style Kit.
